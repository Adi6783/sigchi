You can visit the above site , I have hosted this application on netlify.
I have used react to work on this frontend, using typescript.
As you can see, i have added a functional navigation bar, you can also see a footer.
Speaking about various pages , there is a Contact Us page, an About Us page,a Resouces page, a Team page,a Frequently Asked Questions page, a Mock Coding Tests page,
and obviously the Home page. The mock coding tests page was an inspiration that i took from the acm website of some institute in the west.
